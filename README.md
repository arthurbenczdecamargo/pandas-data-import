# Pandas data import
**Data science using *Jupyter Notebook* and *Pandas* library.**

## Overview
This project uses *Jupyter Notebook* and *Pandas* to load, manipulate, and analyze data from different file formats and databases. The program reads **CSV**, **EXCEL**, **JSON**, **HTML**, and **XML** files into *Pandas DataFrames*, processes the data, and saves the results in various formats. Also, it demonstrates how to interact with *SQL* databases by using *SQLAlchemy* to execute queries and modify tables.

## Features
• Load data from multiple file formats, including **CSV**, **EXCEL**, **JSON**, **HTML**, and **XML**.;<br>
• Read data from a web-based **JSON API**;<br>
• Use *SQLAlchemy* to query, update, and delete *SQL* databases;<br>
• Manipulate and transform data by adding new columns and performing calculations like annual income;<br>
• Create various types of visualizations and analyses using *Pandas*;<br>
• Save manipulated data to new files in different formats.
